# Changelog

All notable changes to jt-glogarch will be documented in this file.

## [1.7.8] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed — Schedule page mirrored running progress to every export schedule

- When one export schedule was running, every other export-type row on the schedules page showed the same progress bar / percentage / message count. The customer report case: an `api-export` schedule (mode=API, manually triggered) and an `auto-export` schedule (mode=OpenSearch, cron-fired) — running either one decorated both rows with identical progress.
- Root cause: `loadSchedules()` in `web/static/js/app.js` did `(jobsData.items || []).find(j => j.status === 'running' && j.job_type === 'export' ...)` to locate "the" running export job, then attached its progress bar to **every** row whose `job_type === 'export'`. There was no way to tell which schedule had triggered the job because the `source` column was only `"manual:api"` / `"scheduled:opensearch"` etc. — no schedule name.
- Fix: extended the `source` field format to a third segment carrying the schedule name. New format: `"{manual|scheduled}:{api|opensearch}:{schedule_name}"`.
  - `scheduler.py::_run_export_once` and `web/routes/api.py::run_schedule_now` now write the third segment.
  - `/api/export` (manual export from the /export page, not bound to any schedule) keeps the two-segment form so it does NOT decorate any schedule row.
- Frontend: `loadSchedules()` now builds `runningBySchedule[name]` from the third segment and only attaches progress to the row whose `name` matches. The two existing `srcType`/`srcMode` consumers (jobs page badges, dashboard recent-jobs badges) ignore unknown extra segments, so they keep working unchanged.
- "Run Now" button visibility is unchanged in spirit: still hidden on every row while any export is running (server-level export lock would reject a concurrent run anyway).

### Fixed — Manual "Run Now" of verify / cleanup did not appear in Job History

- Triggering an `auto-verify` or `auto-cleanup` run via the "立即執行" button only wrote an `audit_log` entry and updated `schedules.last_run_at` — it never touched the `jobs` table. As a result the run was invisible from Job History, Dashboard recent jobs, and the `/api/jobs` API.
- Fix: `web/routes/api.py::run_schedule_now` now creates a `RUNNING` `JobRecord` before invoking `Cleaner`/`Verifier`, transitions it to `COMPLETED` (with a summary in the notes column) or `FAILED` (with a sanitized error) when the call returns. Source format follows the v1.7.8 convention: `manual:cleanup:<name>` / `manual:verify:<name>`. Scheduled cron firings of verify/cleanup also got their source upgraded to `scheduled:verify:<name>` / `scheduled:cleanup:<name>` for consistency with export.

## [1.7.7] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed — Language switch did not fully refresh dynamic content

- The `langchange` listener in `web/static/js/app.js` only re-rendered the `/logs` and `/op-audit` pages. Every other page (`/`, `/archives`, `/jobs`, `/schedules`, `/notify-settings`) had JS-rendered innerHTML (status badges, table cells, modal labels, channel results) that stayed in the previous language until the user manually refreshed the browser.
- Fix: extended the listener to re-fire each page's loader on language change, preserving pagination state (e.g. `archivePage`, `_auditPage`).
- Also i18n'd four hardcoded English fragments: OpenSearch test result (`Connected!` / `Failed:` / `Error:` / `Unknown error` / `Status:` / `Nodes:`), notify channel test outcome (`OK` / `Failed`), GELF Port label, schedule type select options (`Export` / `Cleanup` / `Verify`), and the OK button on info-only confirm dialogs. New i18n keys: `btn_ok`, `test_connected`, `test_failed`, `test_error`, `unknown_error`, `result_ok`, `result_failed`, `os_status`, `os_nodes`, `import_gelf_port`, `sched_type_export/cleanup/verify`.

## [1.7.6] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed — Scheduled verify and cleanup did not appear in Job History

- `_run_verify` and `_run_cleanup` in `glogarch/scheduler/scheduler.py` never wrote a row to the `jobs` table. Only export was tracked, so users running auto-verify or auto-cleanup saw the schedule's `last_run_at` update but found nothing in `/jobs` (作業歷程).
- `_run_export`'s rare failure-path also tried to call `db.create_job(job_id, "export", source="scheduled")` — that signature has not existed since `create_job()` was changed to accept a `JobRecord`. The call was wrapped in `try/except`, so it silently swallowed every error and never recorded the failed export.
- Fix: added `_create_run_job()` / `_finish_run_job()` helpers on `ArchiveScheduler` and routed all three scheduled handlers through them. Each scheduled run now creates a `RUNNING` job at start, then transitions to `COMPLETED` (with summary in the notes column) or `FAILED` (with sanitized error) at the end. Verify with corrupted/missing files is recorded as `FAILED` so it stands out in the UI.

## [1.7.5] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed — Email notification: non-secret fields rendered as masked password inputs

- On the Notification Settings page, **SMTP host**, **SMTP user**, and **From address** were rendered with `_secret()` (`<input type="password">`), so the values were dotted-out and got an unhelpful eye-toggle button. Only the SMTP password should be masked.
- Fix: `web/static/js/app.js` — switched the three fields to plain `<input type="text">` (still XSS-safe via `esc()`); SMTP password remains masked.

## [1.7.4] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed — Schedule changes via Web UI required service restart (critical)

- **Newly-created `auto-verify` (or any custom schedule) never fired**, and edits to existing schedules' cron expressions were ignored, until the service was restarted. `POST /api/schedules`, `POST /api/schedules/{name}/toggle`, and `DELETE /api/schedules/{name}` only wrote to the SQLite `schedules` table — they never told the running APScheduler about the change.
- The "Next run" column in the Web UI is computed live from the cron expression every time the page loads (`api.py::_schedule_to_dict`), so the UI looked correct even though APScheduler had no job registered. This masked the bug.
- `ArchiveScheduler.setup()` only ran once at startup (called from `start()` in the FastAPI lifespan), so the only way to register a new DB schedule with APScheduler was to restart `jt-glogarch.service`.
- Fix: added `ArchiveScheduler.apply_schedule(sched)` and `remove_schedule(name)`. The three schedule API endpoints now call them after the DB write, so changes take effect immediately. `setup()` was also simplified to delegate to `apply_schedule()` for every DB record (DRY) and to bootstrap missing `auto-export` / `auto-cleanup` records from `config.yaml` only on first run.

### Fixed — Custom-named schedules updated wrong `last_run_at` row

- `_run_export`, `_run_cleanup`, `_run_verify` had the schedule name hardcoded (`"auto-export"` / `"auto-cleanup"` / `"auto-verify"`), so a user-named schedule (e.g. `daily-stream-A`) would either skip the timestamp write or stomp the wrong row. `_run_export_once` also loaded its config from the hardcoded `"auto-export"` row, so a custom export schedule silently inherited `auto-export`'s mode/days/streams instead of its own.
- Fix: each handler now takes a `schedule_name` argument; `apply_schedule()` passes the schedule's actual name via APScheduler `args=[sched.name]` so the right row is read for config and updated for `last_run_at`.

## [1.7.3] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed — Export lock leak on early failure (critical)

- **Scheduled exports could get permanently stuck** after a transient failure. If `create_job()` or any operation between `_export_lock[key] = True` and the `try:` block raised an exception (e.g. "database is locked" from SQLite contention), the lock was set but never released. All subsequent retry attempts — and the next day's scheduled run — failed with "Export already running".
- Observed pattern in logs: attempt 1 fails with "database is locked", attempts 2-3 and subsequent scheduled runs fail with "Export already running for 'X'".
- Affected both `glogarch.export.exporter` (API mode) and `glogarch.opensearch.exporter` (OpenSearch mode).
- Fix: moved job creation inside the `try:` block so the existing `finally: _export_lock.pop(...)` always runs, regardless of where the exception originates.

### Improved — Audit server_name fallback to syslog hostname

- When nginx `server {}` block has no `server_name` directive, `$server_name` is empty and all audit records show blank server. jt-glogarch now falls back to the hostname parsed from the syslog envelope (e.g. `log3` from `<190>Apr 19 00:07:15 log3 graylog_audit: {...}`).
- No action required if nginx already has `server_name`; fallback only applies when the JSON field is empty.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-04-17

### Improved — JVM memory guard: pause & resume instead of stop

- API export now **pauses** when Graylog JVM heap exceeds the threshold (default 85%), checks every 30 seconds, and **resumes automatically** when GC recovers. Only stops after 5 minutes of sustained high heap. Previously, export stopped immediately on first threshold breach.
- Progress display shows "JVM heap 87%, paused (waiting for GC)..." during wait.

### Improved — Heartbeat: active probe instead of passive timeout

- Heartbeat no longer alerts simply because no syslog was received for 10 minutes (false positive when nobody is using Graylog). Now sends an active probe through nginx (HTTPS :443) every 5 minutes. Only alerts when the HTTP probe succeeds but no corresponding syslog arrives — indicating nginx forwarding was disabled.
- nginx URL auto-derived from `servers[].url` (same host, HTTPS port 443).

### Improved — Export job UX: accurate totals and skip info

- OpenSearch export now uses `_count` API for accurate document counts instead of `_cat/indices` (which includes deleted/merged docs and overstates the total).
- Completed export jobs show skip info in the notes column: "Skipped 75 indices (already archived)" or "Skipped 4200/4320 chunks (already archived)".
- Interrupted jobs show context: "Interrupted by service restart (502,202 / 1,397,360 processed, partial files cleaned up)".
- Progress detail visible in schedule page (separate line) and sidebar widget.

### Fixed — Schedule "Run Now" export not updating last_run_at

### Fixed — Upgrade script: git safe.directory

- `upgrade.sh` now runs `git config --global --add safe.directory` before `git pull` to prevent "dubious ownership" error when `/opt/jt-glogarch` is owned by `jt-glogarch` user.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-16

### Improved — Export progress UX

- **Scanning/dedup phase shows detail text** — OpenSearch export now shows "Scanning 45/88 indices...", "skipped 75/88 indices (archived)", and "querying graylog_515 (4,651,029 docs)..." instead of a blank 0% progress bar. API export shows "skipped 43/4320 (archived)" during dedup skip phase.
- **Polling fallback shows detail** — when SSE is unavailable, the polling-based progress display shows `current_detail` instead of "0/?" during phases with no records yet.

### Improved — Sensitive operation notification dedup

- **Duplicate entries merged** — identical operations in the same batch (same user, operation, target, status) are now merged with a "×N" suffix instead of sending N separate notification lines. Example: 12 identical logout-401 entries become one line with "×12".

### Fixed — Schedule "Run Now" for export not updating last_run_at

- "Run Now" on export schedules now updates the "Last Run" timestamp on completion. Previously only cleanup and verify schedules updated this field.

### Fixed — Scheduled export retry on transient errors

- Scheduled export now retries up to 3 times (30s delay) on transient errors like "database is locked". On final failure, a failed job record is created so it appears in Job History (previously silent failure — only visible in system logs).

### Fixed — Audit cleanup skipped when no archives exist

- `Cleaner.cleanup()` had an early return that prevented audit record cleanup when no archive files matched retention. Refactored so audit cleanup always runs.

### Fixed — Audit retention independent from archive retention

- `op_audit.retention_days` (default 180) now controls audit record cleanup separately from archive retention (default 1095). `upgrade.sh` auto-adds the field for existing installs.

### Fixed — alert.enable / alert.disable classification

- Event definition schedule/unschedule now classified as `alert.enable` / `alert.disable` instead of generic `alert.modify`, so users can distinguish enable vs disable in audit records and notifications.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added — Operation Audit (Graylog compliance auditing)

Track who did what on Graylog — for compliance auditing. Records full
request body (see exactly what was changed), stored independently
from Graylog (admin cannot delete audit records).

**Architecture:**
- nginx on each Graylog server sends access logs via UDP syslog
- jt-glogarch receives on port 8991, parses, classifies, stores in SQLite
- IP allowlist auto-built from Graylog Cluster API (zero config)
- Whitelist-based filtering: only records meaningful operations (60+ operation types)
- Background polling, static assets, metrics automatically filtered out

**Username resolution:**
- Basic Auth → extract username from Authorization header
- Token auth → resolved via per-user Graylog token API
- Session auth → session ID resolved via Graylog Sessions API
- Cookie session (`$cookie_authentication`) → session ID from nginx log, resolved via API
- Login POST body → extract username → cache by client IP
- Single-user environments → auto-attributed
- Periodic backfill of records without username

**Resource name resolution:**
- Input/Stream/Index Set/Dashboard/Pipeline/Lookup Table IDs → human-readable names
- Cached from Graylog API, refreshed every 6 minutes

**Heartbeat monitoring:**
- Detects silent audit failure (Graylog up but no syslog received)
- Alerts via notification after 10 minutes of silence

**Web UI — "Operation Audit" page:**
- Dashboard-style stat cards with sparkline trends (24h)
- Filterable table (time range, user, method, status, sensitive only)
- Detail modal with JSON syntax-highlighted request body + copy button
- nginx setup instructions with syntax-highlighted config snippet
- Enabled by default; upgrade.sh auto-adds config for existing installs

**Notifications:**
- `on_sensitive_operation` — alert when sensitive operations detected
- `on_audit_alert` — alert when audit pipeline fails (no syslog received)
- Both independently configurable in notification settings

**Security:**
- Session cookie `https_only=True`
- Security headers: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS, Referrer-Policy
- Notification config secrets masked in API responses
- Login error parameter whitelist validation
- UDP listener DoS protection (batch queue limit, packet size limit)
- SSH command injection prevention (`shlex.quote`)

**Config:**
```yaml
op_audit:
  enabled: true          # enabled by default
  listen_port: 8991
  max_body_size: 65536
  alert_sensitive: true
  retention_days: 180
```

**Documentation:**
- `AUDIT-OPERATIONS.md` / `AUDIT-OPERATIONS-zh_TW.md` — full list of 60+ tracked operations
- `CONFIG.md` updated with `op_audit` section
- `README.md` — nginx setup guide with port 9000 firewall instructions

**Tests:** 17 new tests (parser, username decoding, session auth, sensitive classification, DB operations, notify events).

### Fixed — Operation Audit refinements

- **Removed redundant `search.execute` records** — Graylog search creates two API calls: create/update (contains query) + execute (only `global_override`). Only `search.create`/`search.update` is now recorded. The subsequent `/execute` call is filtered out to avoid duplicate entries.
- **Token auth username resolution** — `GET /api/users` doesn't return actual token values. Added fallback to query per-user `GET /api/users/{username}/tokens` endpoint which returns the real token values. Also added async resolution (`_resolve_token_via_api`) for cache misses.
- **Cookie-based session resolution** — browser sessions use cookies, not Authorization header. Added `$cookie_authentication` to the nginx log format to capture the Graylog session cookie. The listener extracts the session ID from the cookie and resolves it via the Graylog Sessions API. Falls back to IP cache when cookie is not available.
- **External users excluded from detection** — `_get_human_users()` incorrectly filtered LDAP/SSO users (`external=true`), causing single-user default attribution to the wrong account. External users are now included.
- **Search target column showed raw URI** — `search.execute` target_name was empty, causing the UI to fall back to showing the full API URI path. Fixed by removing the redundant execute pattern (query is already captured in `search.create`/`search.update`).
- **Audit table missing server column** — added "Server" column before "User" in the Operation Audit table.
- **Auth service operations not tracked** — added `_KEEP_PATTERNS` for `/api/system/authentication/services/backends` (create/modify/delete/activate/deactivate). Also marked as sensitive operations.
- **Content pack name not resolved** — added content pack caching in `_refresh_resource_cache` from Graylog API. Added UUID-with-dashes URI matching in `_resolve_target_name`.
- **Dashboard name not resolved via /api/dashboards** — unified `_resolve_target_name` to match both `/api/views/` and `/api/dashboards/` paths using the same view cache.
- **Lookup adapter/cache names not resolved** — `_refresh_resource_cache` only cached lookup tables. Added caching for data adapters (`/api/system/lookup/adapters`) and caches (`/api/system/lookup/caches`).
- **Audit retention independent from archive retention** — `op_audit.retention_days` (default 180) now controls audit record cleanup separately from archive retention (default 1095 days). Previously, audit cleanup used the archive retention setting and early-returned when no archives existed.
- **Audit cleanup skipped when no archives to clean** — `Cleaner.cleanup()` had an early return that prevented audit record cleanup when no archive files matched the retention criteria. Refactored so audit cleanup always runs.
- **upgrade.sh auto-adds `retention_days`** — existing installs with `op_audit` config but missing `retention_days` get it added automatically during upgrade.

### Fixed — zh_TW terminology

- 損壞 → 損毀 (Taiwan usage)
- 過濾 → 篩選/篩除
- 對象 → 項目
- README cleanup retention example: 60 天 → 1095 天

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-15

### Added — Multi-server schedule support

Export schedules can now target a specific Graylog server. Schedule
form has a new "Graylog Server" dropdown. Schedule table shows the
server name badge in the "Server / Mode" column.

### Added — Terminal-style system log viewer

System Logs "Real-time Log" section now has a dark terminal background
with color-coded lines by log level (ERROR=red, WARN=orange,
info=green, INFO=white, DEBUG=gray, systemd=blue).

### Fixed — System log showed "no data" on some hosts

`jt-glogarch` user lacked `systemd-journal` group membership, so
`journalctl` returned empty. Fixed in `install.sh` and `upgrade.sh`.

### Fixed — OpenSearch mode hint missing Data Node warning

The export mode hint text now always mentions that Data Node
environments do not support OpenSearch direct access.

### Fixed — Modal closes on drag outside

All modals now only close via Save/Cancel buttons, not backdrop click
or mousedown-drag-outside.

### Fixed — Missing pause/close icons

Added `pause` and `close` SVG icons to the ICONS map. Schedule table
enable/disable buttons now show play/pause icons. Cancel buttons show
close icon.

### Fixed — Cleanup/verify run-now didn't update last_run_at

Manually triggered cleanup and verify schedules now update the
`last_run_at` field in the database.

### Fixed — TEST-RESULTS.md had ANSI color codes

`run-tests.sh` now strips all ANSI escape sequences with
`NO_COLOR=1 TERM=dumb` + sed filter.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-14

### Added — Multi-server schedule support

Export schedules can now target a specific Graylog server instead of
always using the default. The schedule form has a new "Graylog Server"
dropdown that lists all configured servers. The schedule table shows
the server name as a badge next to the export mode.

This enables archiving multiple Graylog clusters from a single
jt-glogarch instance — create one schedule per server.

### Fixed — Modal closes on drag outside

All modals (import, schedule edit, confirm) no longer close when the
user mousedowns inside the modal and drags outside. Modals can only be
closed via Save/Cancel buttons.

### Fixed — Missing icons on enable/disable buttons

Schedule table enable/disable buttons now show play/pause icons.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed — Code review findings

- **Security: XSS in OpenSearch test** — `testOpenSearch()` inserted OS
  cluster_name/version/status into innerHTML without `esc()`. Fixed.
- **Bug: Email channel missing from notify status** — `GET /api/notify/status`
  did not include the email channel. Dashboard showed "no channels"
  when only email was enabled.
- **Consistency: `batch_docs` default mismatch** — CLI help said 5000
  but code used 10000. Fixed help text + JS fallback + CLAUDE.md.
- **i18n: Hardcoded Chinese in statusBadge** — `corrupted` and `missing`
  labels were hardcoded in Chinese. Now uses `t('status_corrupted')` /
  `t('status_missing')`.
- **Memory: `_cancel_flags` never pruned** — Added cleanup alongside
  `_job_progress` pruning (keep last 50) in both export and import paths.

### Added — 11 regression tests (`test_recent_fixes.py`)

Covers: notification timezone, Data Node detection, retention default,
batch_docs consistency, Discord args, schedule display, i18n keys.

## [1.5.9] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed — Schedule table showed "days" for OpenSearch mode without index count

When an OpenSearch-mode export schedule had no `keep_indices` set (e.g.
auto-export), the settings column showed "180 天" which was misleading.
Now shows "180 天 (all indices)" to clarify that it exports all indices
within the time range, not a specific count.

## [1.5.8] - 2026-04-14

### Changed — Default retention from 180 days to 3 years (1095 days)

180 days was too short for most compliance scenarios. Changed default
`retention_days` from 180 to 1095 (3 years) in config, CLI example,
JS fallbacks, CONFIG docs, and config.yaml.example.

## [1.5.7] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed — Notification timestamp showed UTC instead of local timezone

Notifications (Telegram, Discord, etc.) displayed timestamps in UTC
(`2026-04-13 19:23:35 UTC`). Changed to use the system's local timezone
(`2026-04-14 03:23:35 CST`). Applies to both scheduled job notifications
and test notifications.

### Changed — Data Node warning text toned down

Import/export dialog Data Node warning changed from "do not use Data
Node" to a neutral factual statement: "Data Node does not support
OpenSearch direct access. Use API/GELF mode instead."

## [1.5.6] - 2026-04-14

### Added — Graylog 7 Data Node compatibility documentation

Tested jt-glogarch against Graylog 7.0.6 with Data Node 7.0.6
(managed OpenSearch 2.19.3). Key findings:

- **OpenSearch Direct export: NOT supported** in Data Node environments.
  Data Node uses Graylog-managed TLS certificate authentication — no
  credentials are exposed, external tools cannot access OS port 9200.
- **OpenSearch Bulk import: NOT supported** for the same reason.
- **Graylog API export: works normally** (uses Graylog REST API).
- **GELF import: works normally** (sends to Graylog GELF input).
- Graylog API proxy (`/api/system/indexer/*`) only supports limited
  read-only endpoints (health, indices info) — no `_search` or `_bulk`
  passthrough.
- Both READMEs updated with Data Node compatibility row in the export
  mode comparison table + user-facing warning note.
- `GET /api/servers` now includes `has_datanode` flag for UI to detect
  and warn users.

## [1.5.5] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed — Test notification broken for Discord/Slack/Teams/Email

The `/notify/test` endpoint called `_send_discord(client, cfg, full_msg)`
with 3 arguments, but the function signature requires 5:
`(client, cfg, title, message, ts)`. Same mismatch for Slack, Teams,
and Email. The call crashed silently, and the frontend showed
"No channels enabled" instead of the actual error.

- Fixed all 4 function calls to pass correct arguments
- Added `test_notify_test_endpoint.py` (7 tests) verifying every
  send function's parameter count and every call site's argument list

## [1.5.4] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed — Graylog API 401 causes infinite "Loading..." in dropdowns

`/api/index-sets` and `/api/streams` did not catch `HTTPStatusError`.
When Graylog returned 401 (bad token), the frontend dropdown stayed on
"Loading..." forever instead of showing an error.

- Backend now catches 401 → returns `{"error": "...authentication failed...", "items": []}` with HTTP 401
- Backend catches connection errors → returns `{"error": "Cannot reach Graylog: ...", "items": []}` with HTTP 502
- Frontend reads `data.error` and displays the message in the dropdown instead of spinning

### Added — One-command upgrade script (`deploy/upgrade.sh`)

```bash
cd /opt/jt-glogarch && sudo bash deploy/upgrade.sh
```

Automates: DB backup → git pull → pip install → restart → verify health.
Displays before/after version. Exits non-zero if health check fails.
README upgrade sections updated to reference the script.

### Fixed — install.sh systemd default was No

`[y/N]` → `[Y/n]`. Pressing Enter now installs the systemd service
(was skipping it, breaking the "5-minute install" promise).

### Fixed — `git clone /opt/` needs sudo

README install instructions now include `sudo git clone`.

### Fixed — Author email and URL

- Email: `jason@jasontools.com` → `jason@jason.tools`
- Jason Tools URL: `https://jasontools.com` → `https://github.com/jasoncheng7115`

### Added — Tests for API error handling + upgrade process

- `test_api_error_handling.py` (4 tests): 401/502/unreachable for index-sets and streams
- `test_upgrade_script.py` (7 tests): script exists, 5 steps, root check, systemd default, README refs

## [1.5.3] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed — Customer install fails: pyproject.toml not found

`git clone` + `pip install /opt/jt-glogarch` failed because the GitHub
repo had `pyproject.toml` and `glogarch/` inside a `src/` subdirectory.
`pip` requires them at the repository root.

- Moved `github/src/glogarch/` → `github/glogarch/`
- Moved `github/src/pyproject.toml` → `github/pyproject.toml`
- Removed `github/src/` directory entirely
- Updated `check-version.sh` and `CLAUDE.md` references
- Added `test_repo_structure.py` (7 tests) to prevent regression

### Added — Upgrade instructions in README

Both READMEs now include a step-by-step upgrade procedure:
`db-backup` → `git pull` → `pip install --force-reinstall` →
`systemctl restart` → verify `/api/health`.

### Added — Upgrade simulation tests (`test_upgrade.py`)

4 tests verifying: old DB auto-migration, old config backward
compatibility, existing archives survive upgrade, DB backup validity.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-04-12

### Added — Emergency local admin login

When Graylog is offline, the Web UI was completely inaccessible because
authentication is delegated to the Graylog REST API. This is a critical
gap for disaster recovery scenarios.

- **`web.localadmin_password_hash`** config option — stores a SHA256
  hash of the emergency password. When Graylog API is unreachable AND
  this hash is configured, the login page accepts the local password
  as fallback. Username must be `localadmin`.
- **Login page feedback** — three distinct error states:
  - Graylog rejects credentials → "Login failed"
  - Graylog offline + hash configured → orange warning with
    instructions to use `localadmin` account
  - Graylog offline + no hash → red error with config hint
- **`glogarch hash-password`** CLI command — interactive prompt to
  generate the SHA256 hash for `config.yaml`.
- **Backward compatible** — the field defaults to empty string
  (disabled). Existing installations without it configured behave
  exactly as before.
- Login logic: Graylog API is always tried first. Local fallback only
  activates when Graylog is unreachable (connection error/timeout),
  NOT when Graylog rejects the credentials (wrong password).

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed — Archive directory ownership auto-repair

Running `glogarch export` as root (without `sudo -u jt-glogarch`)
created archive subdirectories owned by root. Subsequent scheduled
exports by the `jt-glogarch` service user then failed with
`PermissionError: Cannot create archive file`.

- **`ArchiveStorage._fix_dir_ownership()`** — when `mkdir` fails with
  PermissionError and the process is running as root, automatically
  chown non-`jt-glogarch`-owned directories under `base_path` to
  `jt-glogarch`. Scoped to archive directories only — never touches
  system directories above `base_path`.
- **CLI root warning** — running any `glogarch` command as root now
  prints a warning recommending `sudo -u jt-glogarch`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed — OpenSearch `_id` fielddata circuit breaker (critical)

Scheduled OpenSearch exports were failing on large indices (650K+ docs)
with `circuit_breaking_exception: [fielddata] Data too large, data for
[_id] would be [1.6gb], which is larger than the limit of [1.5gb]`.
Three indices (graylog_489, 490, 492) failed consistently every night.

Root cause: `search_after` pagination used `{"_id": "asc"}` as
tiebreaker sort. Sorting by `_id` forces OpenSearch to load the entire
field into heap-resident fielddata — 680K doc IDs consumed 1.6 GB,
exceeding the default circuit breaker limit.

Fix: replaced `_id` tiebreaker with `_doc` (index insertion order).
Zero-cost, no fielddata needed. Verified: graylog_495 (680K docs)
now exports in 3m53s with zero errors.

### Fixed — OpenSearch transient error retry

`OpenSearchClient._request()` previously only retried on connection
errors (ConnectError / ConnectTimeout). HTTP 500, 502, 503, and 429
responses raised immediately without retry or host failover.

Now: transient HTTP errors trigger exponential backoff retry (up to
3 attempts with 1s/2s/4s waits) before falling back to the next host.
Non-transient errors (4xx) still raise immediately.

### Changed — Notification format overhaul

- Removed emoji from body lines — one status emoji on the title line
  only (✅ success, ⚠️ partial errors, ❌ failure)
- Each stat on its own line with clean `label: value` format
- Long URLs in error messages auto-shortened to `<url>` to prevent
  line-breaking in chat clients
- Import notifications now include duration
- Title examples: `✅ 匯出成功`, `⚠️ 匯出完成（有錯誤）`, `❌ 驗證失敗`

### Fixed — Preflight `collect_field_schema` failed on compressed schemas (code review)

`json.loads()` was called directly on the raw `field_schema` column, but
`ArchiveDB.record_archive()` compresses large schemas as `zlib:…`. This
caused preflight to silently fall back to `{}` for large archives, making
mixed-type field conflict detection ineffective. Now uses
`ArchiveDB.decompress_schema()` and logs a warning on parse failure
instead of silently swallowing. Backfill path also uses
`_maybe_compress_schema()` for consistency.

### Fixed — `_dt_to_str()` / `_str_to_dt()` timezone handling (code review)

`replace(tzinfo=None)` stripped timezone info without first converting to
UTC. A `+08:00` datetime would be stored as if it were UTC, shifting the
absolute time by 8 hours. Now calls `astimezone(timezone.utc)` before
stripping. All internal code uses `datetime.utcnow()` (naive UTC) so
existing DB data is unaffected.

### Fixed — Cross-conflict detection missed auto-created numeric mappings (code review)

`get_current_custom_mapping()` only read Graylog's custom field mappings
API. Numeric mappings auto-created by OpenSearch on first document were
invisible, so preflight could miss cross-conflicts (target=long,
archive=string). Now queries the actual OpenSearch mapping of the active
write index via `GET /<deflector>/_mapping` as primary source, with
custom mappings as fallback.

### Added — 55 unit tests (pytest)

First public test suite. Covers: secret sanitization (10), DB datetime
round-trip (5), field_schema compression (6), DB rebuild/backup (5),
cleanup race guard (3), bulk import mechanics (7), concurrent import
lock (5), notification format (7), OpenSearch `_doc` sort (1),
`/api/health` structure (2), preflight conflict computation (4).

### Fixed — Document / implementation consistency (reported by reviewer)

- **FastAPI `version` was hardcoded `"1.3.1"`** in `web/app.py` instead of
  reading `glogarch.__version__`. Now uses the single source of truth.
- **Export metadata `glogarch_version` was hardcoded `"1.3.1"`** in both
  `export/exporter.py` and `opensearch/exporter.py`. Fixed to read
  `__version__` so archive files always carry the correct version.
- **Config search path `/etc/glogarch/`** did not match the install script's
  `CONFIG_DIR="/etc/jt-glogarch"`. Renamed to `/etc/jt-glogarch/` (and
  home dir fallback to `~/.jt-glogarch/`).

## [1.4.4] - 2026-04-10

### Changed — Job History "Error" column → "Note"

- Column header renamed from "Error" / "錯誤" to "Note" / "備註" in
  both en and zh-TW i18n, since the column now carries informational
  notices (e.g. "where to find imported data") alongside actual errors.
- Color logic: red (`--danger`) only for failed jobs or messages
  containing "Compliance violation" / "Interrupted". All other notes
  display in muted grey (`--text-muted`). Applied in both the Jobs
  page and the Dashboard recent-jobs table.

### Fixed — Architecture diagram alignment

ASCII art diagram in both `README.md` and `README-zh_TW.md` had
inconsistent right-border alignment (the outer `|` column drifted
between rows). Redrawn at a fixed 70-char width with Python-verified
alignment.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed — Live progress controls leaked into bulk mode

The import-modal "live controls" bar (Pause + Speed slider) was being
shown for both GELF and bulk imports, even though bulk mode honors
neither. Reported via screenshot showing 50-archive bulk import in
preflight phase with the slider visible at "100ms".

- Wrapped Pause + Speed slider in `#import-gelf-controls` and hid them
  in bulk mode (`doImportSingle` → `gelfControls.style.display='none'
  when mode==='bulk'`)
- Added a real `#import-cancel-btn` (always visible) so bulk imports
  can be cancelled mid-flight from the modal

### Fixed — `/jobs/{id}/cancel` did not stop bulk imports

The cancel endpoint set `_cancel_flags[job_id]` but the bulk loop's
cancel checkpoint reads `ImportFlowControl.cancelled` (set via
`get_import_control(job_id).cancel()`). Two unrelated cancel
mechanisms — pressing Cancel did nothing for bulk. Now the endpoint
also calls `get_import_control(job_id).cancel()` so cancel actually
stops the bulk loop between batches.

### Added — i18n for cancel-import confirmation

`confirm_cancel_import` strings in en + zh-TW (used by the new
`cancelActiveImport()` modal flow).

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-10

End-to-end test of the v1.4.0 hardening release on a Graylog 7 target
(.83) surfaced two latent architectural bugs in bulk import mode plus
several UX issues. All fixed in this release.

### Fixed — Bulk mode imports were invisible to Graylog Search

Symptom: bulk import reported "completed, 159,286 messages" and the
data was confirmed in OpenSearch (`jt_restored_2026_04_09` index, 166 MB),
but searching the `jt-glogarch Restored (jt_restored)` stream in Graylog
returned 0 results. Found that 32 万筆 messages had accumulated as
orphan indices invisible to the UI.

Root cause: `BulkImporter._index_name_for_doc()` derived the target
index name from each doc's `timestamp` field
(`jt_restored_YYYY_MM_DD`). Graylog tracks an index set's membership in
MongoDB by sequential index name (`jt_restored_0`, `jt_restored_1`,
...), NOT by `<prefix>_*` wildcard. Indices created outside that
tracking are invisible to Graylog Search even when their name matches
the prefix. Stream → index_set → MongoDB list query never returned the
date-based indices.

Fix: bulk writes now ALWAYS go through the Graylog-managed deflector
alias (`<prefix>_deflector`). OpenSearch routes the bulk request to
whichever underlying index Graylog has marked `is_write_index=true`,
so:
- Graylog Search picks up our docs immediately (they live in the
  Graylog-tracked write index)
- Graylog's own SizeBased / TimeBased rotation strategy still applies
- No more orphan indices

`_ensure_index()` learned to detect the deflector alias suffix and
verify it via HEAD instead of trying to PUT it (which would fail with
`invalid_index_name_exception`). The per-doc index name walk that
earlier versions did to pre-create date-based indices is gone.

### Fixed — Bulk import "where to find" notice was silently swallowed

Symptom: bulk import succeeds, the Graylog stream is created correctly,
but the import-completed modal in the Web UI shows only "已完成! (N
記錄數)" with no hint about where in Graylog to look for the data. The
backend was writing the notice to `jobs.error_message` correctly (verified
via direct DB query) but the frontend never displayed it.

Root cause (`web/routes/api.py::get_job`): when a job is triggered from
the Web UI, `_job_progress[job_id]` accumulates SSE events. The
`/api/jobs/{id}` endpoint always preferred this in-memory cache over
the DB. The in-memory representation hardcoded `error_message =
last.get("error")` — which is None on success — and never read the
real `error_message` column from the DB. So the where_msg notice was
written but never returned.

Fix: when the in-memory progress shows the job is done (`phase=done`
or `pct>=100`), read the canonical row from the DB instead. This
returns the correct `error_message`, the correct `job_type`, and the
correct status. The in-memory cache is still used for in-progress
polling.

### Fixed — `/api/jobs/{id}` returned wrong `job_type` for imports

Side effect of the same `_job_progress` shortcut: it hardcoded
`"job_type": "export"` regardless of the actual job. Imports triggered
from the Web UI were mislabelled as exports in API responses (the
listing endpoint and Job History UI used a different code path so this
was usually invisible). Now the type is read from the DB row.

### Added — Verify schedule "Run Now" button

The Schedules page already supported run-now for export and cleanup
schedules. Verify schedules were missing the button purely because of
a single condition in the JS render. The backend
`POST /api/schedules/{name}/run` already supported all three job types.
One-line fix in `app.js` re-enables the button for verify schedules.

### Changed — Bulk batch_docs default 5000 → 10000

Validated on `.83` Graylog 7 target during v1.4.1 testing — 10k docs
per `_bulk` request runs cleanly without 429 backpressure. Doubles
throughput on most targets. Adjusted in 4 places: `BulkImporter.
DEFAULT_BATCH_DOCS`, `web/routes/api.py` body default, `index.html`
modal `value`, `cli/main.py --batch-docs` default.

### Documentation — Bulk mode rate slider has no effect

The "Batch Delay (ms)" slider in the import modal applies ONLY to
GELF mode. `BulkImporter.import_archives()` has no inter-batch sleep
in its hot loop — only retry backoff on OpenSearch 429. The slider is
already inside `#gelf-mode-fields` and is hidden when bulk mode is
selected, so users no longer see it as an option in bulk mode. The
real performance dial for bulk mode is `batch_docs`.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-10

Internal point release rolled into 1.4.2 — see above for details.
The deflector-alias bulk write fix landed here originally.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-09

Hardening release. End-to-end test of v1.3.1 surfaced a 20-item risk list
across disaster recovery, secret leakage, retention, race conditions,
reserved field handling, concurrency control, and operational concerns.
This release addresses every item.

### Added — Disaster recovery

- **`glogarch db-backup`** — online SQLite snapshot via the `.backup` API
  (safe while jt-glogarch is writing). Auto-prunes old snapshots
  (`--keep`, default 14). Recommended cron entry:
  `0 4 * * * /usr/bin/python3 -m glogarch db-backup`.
- **`glogarch db-rebuild`** — rebuild the SQLite metadata DB by scanning
  the archive directory. Reads each `.json.gz` metadata block + `.sha256`
  sidecar and re-inserts the row. Existing rows are preserved (no
  duplicates). Use after disaster recovery if the DB is lost or corrupted.

### Added — Operational endpoints

- **`GET /api/health`** — liveness/readiness probe for Prometheus blackbox,
  Kubernetes, Uptime Kuma, etc. Returns 200 (`healthy`) when DB is
  reachable, archive disk is writable + above the configured min-free,
  and the scheduler is running. Returns 503 with an `issues[]` array
  otherwise.

### Added — Maintenance helpers

- **`glogarch streams-cleanup`** — list/delete restored Streams + Index
  Sets created by jt-glogarch (auto-created during bulk-mode imports).
  Both the Graylog Stream and the underlying Index Set are removed
  (Graylog also drops the OpenSearch indices). Use after testing or when
  retiring an archive set.

### Added — Bulk import improvements

- **Cancel checkpoints** — `BulkImporter` now checks the cancel flag
  between batches. Pressing Cancel in the Web UI mid-import now stops
  the bulk write cleanly instead of running to completion.
- **Reserved-field stripping** — bulk body builder now drops `_id`,
  `_index`, `_source`, `_type`, `_routing`, `_parent`, `_version`,
  `_op_type` from each doc. Defends against the rare archive that
  contains a field whose name collides with an OpenSearch metadata
  field.

### Changed — `jt_restored_*` retention

- Previously: `NoopRetentionStrategy` with `max_number_of_indices = 2³¹-1`
  → indices accumulated forever after repeated bulk imports.
- Now: `DeletionRetentionStrategy` with `max_number_of_indices = 30`.
  Adjustable via the new `max_indices` parameter on
  `find_or_create_index_set()`. Protects the cluster from runaway disk
  use.

### Security

- **Secret sanitization for `jobs.error_message`** — new
  `glogarch/utils/sanitize.py` strips passwords / API tokens from any
  string before it lands in `jobs.error_message`, `audit_log.detail`,
  or any error path that goes through `update_job` / `create_job` /
  `audit`. Patterns covered: `Authorization: Basic|Bearer …`,
  `http(s)://user:pass@host`, `password=…`, `token=…`, `api_key=…`,
  and JSON-style `"password": "…"`. Output is also length-capped
  (default 2000 chars).
- **TLS verification** is now plumbed through `PreflightChecker`
  (`verify_ssl` constructor argument, default False). Hardcoded
  `verify=False` removed from the preflight HTTP client.
- **Token-expiry detection** — when an export or import fails with a
  Graylog 401, the error message now reads
  *"Graylog API authentication failed (401). Check that the API token is
  still valid: …"* and triggers the configured notification channel.

### Fixed — Race conditions and concurrency

- **Cleanup vs export race** — cleanup now skips any file modified within
  the last 10 minutes (`RECENT_FILE_GRACE_SECONDS`). Prevents the
  retention sweep from deleting an archive that is still being written
  by an in-flight export.
- **Concurrent import lock** — per-archive lock at the importer level.
  The same archive cannot be imported by two jobs at once (two browser
  tabs, schedule + manual click, CLI + Web UI). Conflicts fail fast with
  a clear message; the lock is released in the importer's `finally`
  block.
- **Notification failures are no longer swallowed** — `notify_*` exceptions
  are now logged as warnings and surfaced in the job's `errors[]` list,
  instead of being silently dropped by `try / except: pass`.

### Performance

- **`glogarch verify --workers N`** — parallel SHA256 hashing across N
  worker threads. Disk I/O bound, so threads work fine. Sequential
  behaviour preserved when `--workers 1` (the default).
- **`field_schema` column auto-compression** — when the per-archive field
  schema JSON exceeds 4 KiB it is now stored as `zlib:` + base64. Decoded
  transparently on read via `ArchiveDB.decompress_schema()`. Keeps the
  metadata DB compact for archives with many distinct fields.

### Documentation

- **DST and APScheduler**: APScheduler honours the system TZ; cron
  expressions like `0 3 * * *` may run twice or be skipped on DST
  transition days. Users who need wall-clock guarantees should use UTC
  cron expressions.
- **`gl2_processing_timestamp` / `gl2_remote_ip` after bulk**: bulk imports
  bypass Graylog's processing chain, so these fields reflect the
  *original* processing time at the source cluster. They are NOT
  rewritten on import. This is by design — bulk mode is intended to
  preserve the source-cluster journey.
- **Single-tenant**: jt-glogarch is single-tenant. There is no per-user
  data scoping in the metadata DB or the Web UI.
- **Web UI overwrites manual edits**: saving any setting from the Web UI
  rewrites `config.yaml` from the in-memory `Settings` object. Manual
  edits made between page load and save will be lost. For
  bulk/automated config changes, edit `config.yaml` directly and
  restart the service.
- **IndexSet name collision**: `find_or_create_index_set` looks up by
  `index_prefix`, not title. If two callers race to create the same
  prefix, the second one reuses the first's index set (the API enforces
  prefix uniqueness server-side).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed — Bulk-mode imports were not visible in Graylog UI

End-to-end test of v1.3.0 bulk mode found that imported documents were
written to OpenSearch correctly but **not searchable from the Graylog UI**.
Root cause: Graylog Search filters by `streams` → index sets, and our docs
had `streams` field containing UUIDs from the SOURCE cluster which don't
exist on the target. Without a target stream bound to the bulk index set,
Graylog had no entry point to query the `jt_restored_*` indices.

- **`PreflightChecker.find_or_create_stream()`** — new method that creates
  a Graylog stream bound to the bulk index set via `POST /api/streams`
  (and resumes it). Bulk preflight now creates this stream right after
  the index set.
- **Graylog 6 + 7 dual-API support** — the stream creation API schema
  differs between Graylog versions:
  - Graylog 7: `CreateEntityRequest_CreateStreamRequest`
    → `{"entity": {<config>}, "share_request": null}`
  - Graylog 6: `UnwrappedCreateEntityRequest_CreateStreamRequest`
    → `{<config>, "share_request": null}` (flat with sibling)

  Try wrapped form first; on 4xx fall back to flat form. Both versions
  verified end-to-end.
- **`BulkImporter.target_stream_id`** — new attribute set by importer from
  the preflight result. Each doc's `streams` field is rewritten to
  `[target_stream_id]` before bulk write, replacing the source-cluster
  UUIDs. Now Graylog Search routes correctly to the new stream → new
  index set → `jt_restored_*` indices.
- **Post-completion notice** — bulk import success now records a "where to
  find your data" message in `jobs.error_message`. CLI prints it as a
  cyan ⓘ note. Web UI Job History shows it as a tooltip; the active import
  modal shows it in an info box on completion.
- **`ImportResult.notices`** — new field for non-error informational
  messages.
- **SSE `done` event was missing `error_message`** — `watchJob` in app.js
  now fetches the full job record on the SSE done event so post-completion
  notices surface in the UI.

### Fixed — Modal display issues

- **Modal too tall** — base `.modal-card` now has `max-height: 90vh` +
  `overflow-y: auto` so a tall import dialog scrolls within the viewport
  instead of overflowing past the top/bottom of the screen.
- **Mode selector card text wrapping char-by-char** — the radio cards
  were too narrow for the original labels. Reduced label text
  (`GELF (Graylog Pipeline)` → `GELF`,
  `OpenSearch Bulk (~5-10x)` → `OpenSearch Bulk`),
  added `min-width: 0` + `overflow-wrap: break-word` to inner divs,
  bumped modal width 420 → 460px.
- **Form re-shown after import completes** — `watchJob` onComplete callback
  was setting `import-modal-form` display back to `block`, leaving the
  form fields visible alongside the completed progress bar. Now the form
  stays hidden after completion; user dismisses the modal via the
  click-outside handler or a future Done button.

### Fixed — Static files not refreshed by `pip install` alone

When editing `web/static/js/*.js` or `web/static/css/*.css`, FastAPI's
StaticFiles mount serves from the **installed package** at
`/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/glogarch/web/static/`, not from
`/opt/jt-glogarch/glogarch/web/static/`. Rsyncing static files into `/opt`
alone is not enough — must always run `pip install --force-reinstall`
afterwards. Documented in CLAUDE.md.

### Changed — Taiwan terminology cleanup

- `推薦` → `建議` (i18n bulk_dedup_id, README-zh_TW)
- `殘留檔案` → `殘留檔案` (README-zh_TW)
- Removed all "v1.1+ archives" / "v1.0 archives" version-history language
  from user-facing docs and code comments since v1.3.0 is the first
  public release.
- Removed obsolete SSH journal monitoring references from README — only
  Graylog API journal monitoring remains.

### Added — README language switcher

Both `README.md` and `README-zh_TW.md` now have a language toggle line
at the top: `**Language**: **English** | [繁體中文](README-zh_TW.md)`
(and the mirror in zh-TW). GitHub renders the relative link to switch
between the two READMEs.

### Added — `gl2_message_id` preserved during export

Exporters preserve `gl2_message_id` (used as bulk-import dedup key);
other `gl2_*` fields are still stripped. GELF import path is unaffected
since Graylog regenerates all `gl2_*` on receive.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added — OpenSearch Bulk Import Mode

New high-throughput import mode that bypasses Graylog entirely and writes
directly to OpenSearch via the `_bulk` API. Verified end-to-end via CLI.

- **`glogarch/import_/bulk.py`** — `BulkImporter` class
  - Reads archives, builds NDJSON bulk requests, parses per-doc results
  - Daily index naming: `<pattern>_YYYY_MM_DD` based on each doc's timestamp
  - Pre-creates target indices (Graylog clusters typically have
    `action.auto_create_index = false`)
  - Three dedup strategies: `id` (use `gl2_message_id` as `_id`, overwrites
    on re-import), `none`, `fail`
  - Exponential backoff on OpenSearch 429 (rate-limited) responses
  - Marker field `_jt_glogarch_imported_at` injected for traceability
- **Preflight extensions** for bulk mode:
  - `auto_detect_opensearch_url()` — derives OpenSearch URL from Graylog
    API URL (port 9000 → 9200) and probes connectivity
  - `find_or_create_index_set()` — auto-creates a Graylog index set for
    the bulk target prefix so restored data is searchable from the
    Graylog UI immediately
  - `apply_bulk_template()` — writes an OpenSearch index template for the
    bulk target pattern with `total_fields.limit: 10000` and all
    string-typed fields pinned as `keyword`
  - `PreflightChecker.run(mode='bulk', ...)` branch: skips Graylog
    deflector cycle (irrelevant) and instead writes the bulk template +
    creates the Graylog index set
- **`Importer`** accepts `mode='bulk'` + `bulk_importer` parameter and
  branches before the GELF send loop
- **Web UI modal** rebuilt with mode selector:
  - Two radio cards: `GELF (Graylog Pipeline)` (default) and
    `OpenSearch Bulk (~5-10x)`
  - Bulk mode shows an orange warning explaining what's skipped
  - Bulk-mode-only fields: target index pattern, dedup strategy,
    batch size, OpenSearch auto-detect checkbox + manual URL/credentials
  - Switching modes hides/shows field groups; values persist across
    switches; Graylog API credentials are shared between modes
  - 23 new i18n strings (en + zh-TW)
  - New CSS: `.mode-selector`, `.mode-option`, `.bulk-warning`
- **CLI `import` command** new options:
  - `--mode [gelf|bulk]`
  - `--target-os-url`, `--target-os-username`, `--target-os-password`
  - `--target-index-pattern` (default `jt_restored`)
  - `--dedup-strategy [id|none|fail]`
  - `--batch-docs` (default 5000)
- **Trade-offs documented** — bulk mode skips ALL Graylog processing
  (Pipelines, Extractors, Stream routing, Alerts). Use only for
  "restore archived data as-is" scenarios.

### Added — gl2_message_id preserved during export

To enable deterministic dedup in bulk import, both exporters preserve
the `gl2_message_id` field. Other `gl2_*` fields (`gl2_source_input`,
`gl2_processing_timestamp`, etc.) are still stripped because they reference
source-cluster nodes/inputs that don't exist in the target.

- **`opensearch/client.py`** — `iter_index_docs` keeps `gl2_message_id`
- **`graylog/search.py`** — `_extract_messages` keeps `gl2_message_id`
- GELF import path is unaffected — Graylog regenerates all `gl2_*` fields
  on receive, including a fresh `gl2_message_id`.

### Added — IMPORTING-state crash recovery

`ArchiveDB.connect()` now resets any archive stuck in `importing` state
back to `completed` on startup, with a warning log. Cause: when an import
process is killed (`-9`, OOM, crash) the importer's `finally` block doesn't
run, leaving the archive permanently flagged as `importing` and invisible
in the Web UI archive list. Now recovered automatically on next service
start or DB connect.

### Added — UI polish (continuing v1.2.0 work)

- **GELF Host → Graylog API URL auto-fill** — typing an IP into GELF Host
  auto-suggests `http://<ip>:9000` for the API URL field, but only if the
  user hasn't manually edited the API URL. Same `data-user-edited` flag
  pattern as the GELF port auto-switch.
- **Reopen running import modal from sidebar** — if the user accidentally
  clicks outside an in-progress import modal to dismiss it, clicking the
  sidebar running-job indicator reopens the modal in progress mode (form
  hidden, progress bar + controls visible). The watcher (SSE + polling)
  keeps running in the background while the modal is closed.
  - `closeImportModal()` early-returns if `_activeImportJobId` is set,
    preserving all state instead of resetting it
  - New `reopenActiveImportModal()` function
  - Sidebar `checkRunningJobs()` adds `cursor: pointer` + `onclick` handler
- **Import modal i18n complete** — `Pause`/`Resume` button, `Speed:` label,
  `sending`/`paused` phase text, `Journal: X (slow)` badge, and the
  `(N archives)` count in the "import started" message all now translate.
- **`completed_with_failures` job badge** — orange shield-checkmark icon
  in the Job History table when a `completed` job has an `error_message`
  containing "Compliance violation". Hover shows the full violation
  message. Pure frontend logic (no DB schema change).

### Fixed — bugs found during v1.3.0 CLI testing

- **`def list(...)` shadowing Python builtin** in `cli/main.py` — the
  `list` CLI command was defined as `def list(...)`, which placed a click
  Command object at the module-level name `list`, shadowing the builtin.
  Inside `import_cmd`, the line `ids = list(archive_id) if archive_id else None`
  was actually invoking the click Command, producing a confusing
  `TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()` from click's argument
  parser. Renamed to `def list_cmd(...)` with `@cli.command("list")`.
- **Bulk path failed with `index_not_found_exception`** — Graylog clusters
  typically set OpenSearch `action.auto_create_index = false`, so the
  `_bulk` API can't auto-create the daily target indices. `BulkImporter`
  now scans archive timestamps in the pre-flight pass to enumerate every
  needed daily index name and PUTs them all (idempotent: 400 with
  `resource_already_exists_exception` is treated as success).
- **`pip install` no-op when version unchanged** — if the package version
  in `pyproject.toml` doesn't change between code edits, `pip install`
  silently treats it as already-installed and skips. Always use
  `--force-reinstall --no-deps` after editing source.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added — Compliance Pipeline (Zero-Loss Import)

This release introduces a complete compliance pipeline for log restoration. Goal:
**zero message loss + zero indexer failures** when importing archived logs back
into a target Graylog. Verified end-to-end with 8.28M-message imports across 67
hourly archives spanning 2 days.

- **Field schema recording during export** — `archives.field_schema` column (JSON)
  now stores `{field_name: [observed types]}` for every archive. Both the
  OpenSearch and API exporters accumulate this in `StreamingArchiveWriter` while
  writing each message (cost: ~10 µs/msg, negligible). Used by import preflight.
- **`glogarch/import_/preflight.py`** — new module that runs **before** any GELF
  send and guarantees the target Graylog index will accept every message:
  1. Verifies target Graylog API credentials
  2. **Cluster health check** — refuses to import if OpenSearch cluster is RED
  3. **GELF input check** — verifies a GELF input exists on the configured port,
     is in `RUNNING` state, and warns about `override_source`, `decompress_size_limit`,
     `max_message_size` settings that might silently corrupt or drop messages
  4. **Existing journal pressure check** — warns if target's journal already has
     >100K uncommitted entries
  5. **Capacity check** — reads rotation/retention strategy of the target index
     set; estimates how many indices the import will create; **aborts** if the
     deletion-based retention policy would erase data we just wrote
  6. **Field schema collection** — pulls `field_schema` JSON from DB for each
     selected archive (milliseconds). For pre-1.2.0 archives without schema,
     falls back to scanning the .json.gz file inline and backfills the DB
  7. **Conflict detection** — pins a field as `keyword` (string) on the target
     only if (a) the archive observed both numeric and string values for it
     (intra-archive conflict, guaranteed mapping clash) OR (b) target's current
     mapping is numeric while archive has strings. Avoids over-pinning the
     1000-field limit
  8. **OpenSearch field limit override** — automatically PUTs an OpenSearch
     index template named `jt-glogarch-field-limit` with
     `index.mapping.total_fields.limit: 10000`, eliminating the
     "Limit of total fields [1000] has been exceeded" error that breaks index
     rotation when many custom mappings are set
  9. **Custom field mappings + cycle** — applies the conflict-pinned mappings
     via Graylog `PUT /api/system/indices/mappings` (one PUT per field with
     `rotate: false`), then issues a single deflector cycle so the new mappings
     take effect on the new active write index
  10. **Wait for new index** — polls until the new active write index is ready
- **Post-import reconciliation** — after the GELF send completes, jt-glogarch
  queries Graylog's indexer-failures total and compares against the pre-import
  baseline. Any non-zero delta is recorded in `jobs.error_message` and the job
  is marked completed with a compliance violation note
- **Mandatory target Graylog API credentials** — the import dialog now requires
  `target_api_url` + (`target_api_token` OR `target_api_username` + `target_api_password`).
  Both frontend and `POST /api/import` reject missing credentials. The same
  credentials power preflight, journal monitoring, and reconciliation
- **Notification field masking** — All credential fields (Bot Token, Chat ID, webhook URLs, SMTP password, Nextcloud token/user/pass, etc.) are now masked by default with an eye-icon toggle button to reveal/hide
- **Sidebar logo link** — Clicking the `jt-glogarch` title in the sidebar opens the project repository in a new tab
- **Archive timeline visualization** on Archive List page
  - Daily distribution bar chart with bar height proportional to record count
  - Drag to select time range with hour-level precision (auto-fills filter and applies)
  - Hover with vertical cursor line, full-column hover area, dashed cursor follows mouse
  - Hover tooltip shows date, archive count, record count, file size
  - Clear selection button (always reserves space to prevent layout shift)
  - Bordered chart with accent-colored bars and red markers for gap days
- **Table flash animation** when filter applied or data reloaded
- **Import flow control system**
  - Pause/resume during import via Web UI
  - Real-time speed adjustment (batch delay slider)
  - **Three monitoring modes** to prevent target Graylog buffer/journal overflow:
    - None (manual control)
    - Graylog API monitoring (`/api/system/journal`)
    - SSH monitoring (remote `du` on journal directory)
  - Dynamic rate control based on `uncommitted_journal_entries`:
    - >100K → triple delay
    - >500K → auto-pause 30s
    - >1M → stop import + admin notification
- **OpenSearch keep_indices mode**
  - Schedule by "keep N most recent indices" instead of days
  - Allows N > current index count (anticipating future growth)
  - UI shows `60 份 Index` instead of `180 天`
- **Dashboard 5th stat card**: original (uncompressed) size with sparkline
- **Sparkline tooltips**: hover bars show date and value
- **Tabular numerals** in timeline tooltip for consistent width as digits change

### Changed — Compliance Pipeline Side Effects
- **Import dialog refactored**: removed Journal-monitoring dropdown (`None`/`API`/`SSH`) and the entire SSH-monitoring code path. Target Graylog API credentials are now always required (one set powers preflight, journal monitoring, and reconciliation).
- **Default GELF protocol = TCP / port = 32202** (was UDP / 12201). UDP is still selectable but README explicitly warns about silent packet loss under load.
- **TCP backpressure + journal monitoring** are always-on. The importer auto-pauses when target Graylog's `uncommitted_journal_entries` exceeds 500K and resumes after 30 s, preventing buffer overflow.
- **`POST /api/import`, `POST /api/export`, `POST /api/schedules/{name}/run`** now run their work in a worker thread (`asyncio.run(...)` inside `loop.run_in_executor`) so the main FastAPI event loop is no longer blocked by gzip/JSON/GELF CPU work. Web UI stays responsive during multi-million-message imports/exports.
- **`ArchiveScheduler._run_export`** is registered with APScheduler via a sync wrapper (`_run_export_in_thread`) for the same reason.
- Compressed size card label changed to "Compressed" (vs new "Original Size")
- Records count display: `9,458,948 of 9,458,948` (bold + dimmed total)
- Sidebar toggle button vertically aligned with logo
- Dark theme number colors brightened for readability
- Notification settings: unchecked channels auto-collapse their config fields
- Notification test endpoint bypasses event-type check (always sends if channel enabled)
- "操作" → "動作" (Taiwan terminology, throughout UI)

### Fixed — Compliance Pipeline Bugs Found During Validation
- **OpenSearch exporter cross-index data loss** — `is_time_range_covered()` was blocking sister indices in the same OpenSearch run from writing data for hours that span an index rotation boundary. Symptom: visibly low message counts on certain hours. Fixed by adding `exclude_stream_id_prefix` so cross-mode dedup only applies across mode boundaries, not within an OpenSearch run. **This was causing ~17% data loss on affected hours**.
- **Web UI import dialog state leak** — `_batchImportIds` was being cleared immediately after the POST returned (success or fail), so retry attempts after a failed first import silently did nothing. Fixed by deferring cleanup until `closeImportModal()`.
- **Web UI import dialog progress residue** — failed import progress bar/text persisted into the next attempt visually. Fixed by resetting bar width and text content at the start of `watchJob()`.
- **Web UI import dialog wrong host on retry** — related to the above; new code now correctly reads form values for each retry.
- **OpenSearch field limit exceeded** — when applying many custom field mappings, Graylog's auto-generated index template exceeded OpenSearch's default 1000-field-per-index limit, causing `Limit of total fields [1000] has been exceeded` and breaking index rotation. Preflight now installs an override template `jt-glogarch-field-limit` with `total_fields.limit: 10000`.
- **Stale custom field mappings on target** — when preflight aborts mid-flow, the partially-applied custom mappings stay in Graylog's MongoDB and clobber subsequent index rotations. Documented cleanup procedure in README.
- FastAPI route order: `/archives/timeline` must be before `/archives/{archive_id}` (422 error)
- pip install cache: `build/` directory caused stale installs (now force-reinstalled)
- Schedule edit modal: `keep_indices` value not restored after coverage widget loads
- Single click on timeline no longer clears existing selection (now moves the highlight to a 1-hour box at the click position)
- Archive timeline bar height now uses message count (not file count)
- Notification test was blocked by `_should_send` event-type check
- OpenSearch resume point removed (relied on per-chunk dedup to avoid gaps)
- Schedule edit: pause auto-refresh polling while modal is open
- Mode selector reset bug during edit (caused by `initCustomSelects` race)
- Import dialog: GELF Port input and Protocol select now have matching height (38px) and vertical alignment
- Import dialog: Graylog API URL / API Token / Username / Password / SSH Host / SSH Port / SSH User / Journal Path labels and placeholders now respect the i18n language setting
- Journal monitoring dropdown: option labels (`None (manual control)` / `Graylog API` / `SSH`) were always English — added a `data-i18n-opt` handler in `i18n.js` so they translate
- Notification password fields are now `type="password"` by default with autocomplete disabled, preventing accidental exposure on shared screens
- All version display locations unified to v1.2.0 (login page, sidebar, package metadata, exporter `glogarch_version`)

### Documentation
- README updated with installation SOP improvements
- install.sh now cleans `build/` cache before pip install
- Deployed and verified on fresh Ubuntu 22.04 LXC
- Repository URL corrected throughout README/CHANGELOG/`jt-glogarch.service` to `https://github.com/jasoncheng7115/jt-glogarch`
- New FAQ entry: scheduled job didn't run at expected time → check that the system timezone matches the timezone you wrote your cron expression in (APScheduler inherits the system timezone)
